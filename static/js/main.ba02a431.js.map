For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n\t   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n\t   *\n\t   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n\t   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n\t   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n\t   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n\t   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n\t   *\n\t   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n\t   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n\t   *\n\t   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n\t   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n\t   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n\t   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n\t   *\n\t   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n\t   *\n\t   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n\t   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set.

The arguments passed to this function are:\n\t * - `outerValue`: the value that came from the source\n\t * - `innerValue`: the value that came from the projected Observable\n\t * - `outerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value that came from the source\n\t * - `innerIndex`: the \"index\" of the value from the projected Observable\n\t * @return {Observable} An Observable that emits the result of applying the\n\t * projection function (and the optional `resultSelector`) to each item emitted\n\t * by the source Observable and taking only the values from the most recently\n\t * projected inner Observable.\n\t * @method switchMap\n\t * @owner Observable\n\t */\n\tfunction switchMap(project, resultSelector) {\n\t    return this.lift(new SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector));\n\t}\n\texports.switchMap = switchMap;\n\tvar SwitchMapOperator = (function () {\n\t    function SwitchMapOperator(project, resultSelector) {\n\t        this.project = project;\n\t        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n\t    }\n\t    SwitchMapOperator.prototype.call = function (subscriber, source) {\n\t        return source.subscribe(new SwitchMapSubscriber(subscriber, this.project, this.resultSelector));\n\t    };\n\t    return SwitchMapOperator;\n\t}());\n\t/**\n\t * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n\t * @ignore\n\t * @extends {Ignored}\n\t */\n\tvar SwitchMapSubscriber = (function (_super) {\n\t    __extends(SwitchMapSubscriber, _super);\n\t    function SwitchMapSubscriber(destination, project, resultSelector) {\n\t        _super.call(this, destination);\n\t        this.project = project;\n\t        this.resultSelector = resultSelector;\n\t        this.index = 0;\n\t    }\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._next = function (value) {\n\t        var result;\n\t        var index = this.index++;\n\t        try {\n\t            result = this.project(value, index);\n\t        }\n\t        catch (error) {\n\t            this.destination.error(error);\n\t            return;\n\t        }\n\t        this._innerSub(result, value, index);\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._innerSub = function (result, value, index) {\n\t        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n\t        if (innerSubscription) {\n\t            innerSubscription.unsubscribe();\n\t        }\n\t        this.add(this.innerSubscription = subscribeToResult_1.subscribeToResult(this, result, value, index));\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._complete = function () {\n\t        var innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n\t        if (!innerSubscription || innerSubscription.closed) {\n\t            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n\t        }\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._unsubscribe = function () {\n\t        this.innerSubscription = null;\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyComplete = function (innerSub) {\n\t        this.remove(innerSub);\n\t        this.innerSubscription = null;\n\t        if (this.isStopped) {\n\t            _super.prototype._complete.call(this);\n\t        }\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype.notifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex, innerSub) {\n\t        if (this.resultSelector) {\n\t            this._tryNotifyNext(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n\t        }\n\t        else {\n\t            this.destination.next(innerValue);\n\t        }\n\t    };\n\t    SwitchMapSubscriber.prototype._tryNotifyNext = function (outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex) {\n\t        var result;\n\t        try {\n\t            result = this.resultSelector(outerValue, innerValue, outerIndex, innerIndex);\n\t        }\n\t        catch (err) {\n\t            this.destination.error(err);\n\t            return;\n\t        }\n\t        this.destination.next(result);\n\t    };\n\t    return SwitchMapSubscriber;\n\t}(OuterSubscriber_1.OuterSubscriber));\n\t//# sourceMappingURL=switchMap.js.map\n\n/***/ },\n/* 807 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t\"use strict\";\n\tvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n\t    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n\t    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n\t    d.prototype = b === null ?

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n    if (a === b) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !isIterable(b) ||\n      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n    ) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\n    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n      var entries = a.entries();\n      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n        var entry = entries.next().value;\n        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n      }) && entries.next().done;\n    }\n\n    var flipped = false;\n\n    if (a.size === undefined) {\n      if (b.size === undefined) {\n        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n          a.cacheResult();\n        }\n      } else {\n        flipped = true;\n        var _ = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = _;\n      }\n    }\n\n    var allEqual = true;\n    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n        allEqual = false;\n        return false;\n      }\n    });\n\n    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n  }\n\n  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\n    function Repeat(value, times) {\n      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n        return new Repeat(value, times);\n      }\n      this._value = value;\n      this.size = times === undefined ?
